# Setup and Configuration Reflection

The initial setup of this Django project, while generally straightforward, presented two main challenges. The first was ensuring the **virtual environment (venv)** was properly activated before installing dependencies. Initially, I forgot this step, which led to Django being installed globally. I solved this by immediately deactivating (if I had remembered the right command, which was `deactivate` in that moment) and then deleting the global installation using `pip uninstall django` outside the venv, followed by creating a fresh venv and running `pip install django` again after activation. This confirmed that project dependencies were isolated.

The second minor challenge was configuring the **URL inclusion** to get past the "You have not configured any URLs" page. I initially defined the `path('', include('pages.urls'))` line incorrectly, which caused a `No module named` error because the inclusion path was wrong. I resolved this by meticulously checking my project structure and ensuring the `include()` function in the main `urls.py` correctly referenced the application's URL module as a string (e.g., `'pages.urls'`). Seeing the custom home page finally render confirmed the URL dispatcher was functioning as expected, setting the stage for implementing the required template inheritance. This process underscored the importance of app naming conventions and directory structure in Django.
